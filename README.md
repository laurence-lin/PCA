# PCA
Apply PCA on wine dataset, to show that by the dimension reduction principal component, the extracted feature is available to perform classification task.

Use 80% for train set, 20% for test set

Testing accuracy: 0.805
The test accuracy could reach 1.0 by random, but sometimes get bad performance like 0.1. 
Use the LogisticRegression package in sklearn is not stable.
